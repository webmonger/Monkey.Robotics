# Drive the Robot with the Robotroller App

The Robots are driven over Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) via the Robotroller Xamarin.Forms app. To get the Robotroller app:

 1. Clone the [Monkey.Robotics](https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.Robotics) github repo.
 2. Navigate to the [MobileRobotroller](../../Sample%20Apps/MobileRobotroller) app and deploy it from either Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio
 
> Note: The Robotroller currently has a bug in Android that causes it to immediately disconnect. We're working on it presently. In the meantime, it can only be deployed to iOS devices.
